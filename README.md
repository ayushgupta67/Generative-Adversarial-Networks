Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for CIFAR-10
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Keras library to generate new images based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. A GAN consists of two main components: a Generator and a Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in an adversarial process.

The Models
Discriminator: A convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images as either "real" (from the CIFAR-10 dataset) or "fake" (generated by the Generator). It's trained to be as accurate as possible.

Generator: A deep learning model that takes a random noise vector as input and outputs a new image. Its goal is to create images so realistic that they can fool the Discriminator.

GAN: A combined model where the Generator's output is fed into the Discriminator. In this setup, the Discriminator's weights are frozen, and the entire network is trained to optimize the Generator. This forces the Generator to improve its image-creation capabilities.

How It Works
The training process is a continuous loop:

Generate Samples: A batch of real images is loaded from the CIFAR-10 dataset, and an equal-sized batch of fake images is generated by the Generator.

Train Discriminator: The Discriminator is trained on both real and fake images. It learns to distinguish between the two, with real images labeled 1 and fake images labeled 0.

Train Generator: The entire GAN model is then trained. The Generator creates a new batch of images, but the Discriminator is "tricked" into thinking these are real by labeling them 1. The goal here is not to improve the Discriminator but to update the Generator's weights so that it can produce more convincing images.

This process is repeated over many epochs, allowing the Generator to become a highly effective image creator and the Discriminator to become a strong classifier.

Instructions for Use in Google Colab
This code is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment.

Prerequisites: Ensure you have a working Python environment with Keras, Matplotlib, and NumPy installed.

!pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy

Mount Google Drive: To save the generated images permanently, you can mount your Google Drive by running the following code cell and following the authentication steps:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

Define and Train Models: Run the code cells in the following order:

Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Define the Discriminator model.

Define the Generator model.

Define the combined GAN model.

Run the train() function to begin the training process. The model's progress (loss values) will be printed to the console.

Save Final Images: After the training is complete, you can generate and save a final set of images to your Google Drive.

# Create a folder if it doesn't exist
import os
output_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/GAN_Output'
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Generate final images
n_samples = 49
X_final, _ = generate_fake_samples(g_model, latent_dim, n_samples)

# Save plot
def save_final_plot(examples, n=7):
    examples = (examples + 1) / 2.0
    for i in range(n * n):
        pyplot.subplot(n, n, 1 + i)
        pyplot.axis('off')
        pyplot.imshow(examples[i])

    filename = os.path.join(output_dir, 'final_generated_images.png')
    pyplot.savefig(filename)
    pyplot.close()

save_final_plot(X_final)
print("Final generated images saved to Google Drive.")
